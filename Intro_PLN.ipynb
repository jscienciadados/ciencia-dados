        "Tudo o que expressamos (verbalmente ou por escrito) carrega enormes quantidades de informação.\n",
        "\n",
        "O tópico que escolhemos, nosso tom, nossa seleção de palavras, tudo acrescenta algum tipo de informação que pode ser interpretada e com o valor extraído dela. Em teoria, podemos entender e até prever o comportamento humano usando essas informações.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mas há um problema: uma pessoa pode gerar centenas ou milhares de palavras em uma declaração, cada sentença com sua complexidade correspondente. Se você deseja dimensionar e analisar várias centenas, milhares ou milhões de pessoas ou declarações em uma determinada região, a situação é incontrolável.\n",
        "\n",
        "Dados gerados a partir de conversas, declarações ou até tweets são exemplos de dados não estruturados. Os dados não estruturados não se encaixam perfeitamente na estrutura tradicional de linhas e colunas de bancos de dados relacionais e representam a grande maioria dos dados disponíveis no mundo real. É confuso e difícil de manipular.\n",
        "\n",
        "No entanto, graças aos avanços em disciplinas como aprendizado de máquina, uma grande revolução está acontecendo em relação a esse tópico. Atualmente, não se trata mais de tentar interpretar um texto ou discurso com base em suas palavras-chave (a maneira mecânica antiquada), mas de entender o significado por trás dessas palavras (a maneira cognitiva). Dessa forma, é possível detectar figuras de linguagem como ironia, ou mesmo realizar análises de sentimentos."
